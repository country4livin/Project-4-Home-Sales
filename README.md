## Project Overview
Project 4 pulls together skills learned throughout the Data Analytics Bootcamp to create a Real estate map and prediction model. An interactive map shows real estate sales in the target area. A web interface allows users to input the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and size of house and lot. An html-based interface is connected to a machine-learning model. The model uses Random Forest to predict the optimal sale price for the house. 

## Data Source
<<<<<<< HEAD
 - Used API for realtor.com to call for single family homes in/around St. Paul, MM.
 - Used Pandas to pull desired data: list price, list date, sold price, sold date, bedrooms, baths, square footage, lot square footage, address and coordinates.
 - Formatted dataframe and save as a .csv file.

## Create Predictive Model
=======
 - Connected to rapidapi.com and queried twin cities area MN Real Estate sales for single-family homes.  
 - The areas queried in are based on zip codes in St. Paul and the surrounding areas including Roseviile, North Oaks, Shoreview, Hugo, White Bear Lake, Arden Hills, Gem Lake, New Brighton, Little Canada, Maplewood, West St. Paul, Falcon Heights, Mounds View, Lauderdale, Mendota Heights and North St. Paul. 
 - Due to API calls limitaions, the data goes back to sale date of December 2024 and includes about 1300 entries.

 - A model was developed to predict the number of days on market based on the user input. 
 - The model used XGBoost, a type of decision tree machine learning model commonly used in real estate.
 - Many attemps were made to optimize this model, however, results peaked at 71% R2 accuracy. 
 - Ultimately, the group decided not to include this model in the final project due to the low accuracy.

## Create Folium map 
 - Upload CSV and create Folium map to show recently sold homes that match a users input (beds, bath, square footage)

## Build Webpage
 - Build an intereactive user face
 - User can put in features from their property and it will reference the model to make a prediction for what their home will sell for
